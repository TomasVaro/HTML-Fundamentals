# HTML-Demonstration
Assignment 1: Build two basic HTML structured pages. First is Index page that will greet the visitors and present some articles and a bit of statistics on the side. Second is a Login page that gives the user a form to fil in to sign in with (fake, no login service).
Only make the HTML elements and their contents, you are not allowed to use styling in this assignment (only exception is setting the size of images).

Assignment 2: You will take a complete HTML page (the one you made in the assignment 1), and style it using CSS. You are to avoid modifying html elements of the page(s) as much as possible, apart from adding classes or ids to elements.
